# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses **Linear Regression** to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. It's a beginner-friendly application of supervised machine learning in the field of **financial data analysis**.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Stock market prediction is a classic yet challenging use-case of machine learning. In this project, we:

- Use historical Reliance stock data
- Prepare the dataset by scaling and creating a shifted label for prediction
- Train a **Linear Regression** model
- Forecast stock prices for the next `n` days
- Evaluate the model’s performance using R² score

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from **[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)**. You can manually download any stock's historical data as a `.csv` file. This project uses the **Reliance** stock data.





## 🎯 Future Improvements

* Use other models (e.g., LSTM, XGBoost)
* Include multiple features (Volume, High, Low, etc.)
* Add data visualization for prediction trends
* Build a web dashboard using Streamlit
